    "- Low-level vs. High-level language\n",
    "    - Python is a high-level language\n",
    "    - Higher the level increases portability and simplicity but decreases efficiency\n",
    "- Modules oragnize code into function and promote reuse of code\n",
    "- Object-oriented design involves use of classes and objects\n",
    "    - Classes: Defining new data types go into classes. Both functions and related data are grouped into classes. Constructors, like \"__init__\", are used to construc the object and set default properties of the class\n",
    "        - Subclassing is useful and efficient for copying and modifying another class (and \"super\")\n",
    "    - Objects: Specific instances of data in classes are objects that posses their own functions, or methods\n"
